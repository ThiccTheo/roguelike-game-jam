===== Project Structure =====

- Components are PODs and should not have methods.

- Utility methods are an exception, but they should typically be constructors or have &self/&mut self.

- Each module should typically have an associated plugin.

- Plugins should not have methods besides build.

- A function is considered a system if it has either Query or Commands as a parameter.

- Systems should be free-floating functions.
